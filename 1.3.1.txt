    Using the up arrow, print to the screen the strings “fee”, “fie”, “foe”, and “fum” without retyping echo each time.

    As seen in Listing 1.2, by default the echo command prints its argument to the screen and then puts the new prompt on a new line. The way it does this is by appending a special character called a newline that literally puts the string on a new line. (The newline character is usually written as \n, pronounced “backslash n”.) Because echo is often used in programs to print out a sequence of strings not separated by newlines, there is a special command-line option to prevent the newline from being inserted.

    According to the man page, what are the official short and long descriptions of echo on your system?
